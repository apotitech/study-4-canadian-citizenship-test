# :canada: Canadian Citizenship Test - History

This timeline was built from the notes I took while studying for the Canadian Citizenship Test.
I needed to build a timeline because the study guide for the Canadian Citizenship test
is organized by topic making it difficult to follow the complete history of Canada in a linear way.

## :warning: DISCLAIMER

This timeline comes with no guarantee of completeness or accuracy.
These are my personal notes that haven't been reviewed and therefore most likely contain
typos, errors and missed entries.
